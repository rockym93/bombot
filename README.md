Some bots which pull Aurora Australis data from the Bureau of Meteorology. 

Right now just the Telegram one is up at [@AusAuroraBot](https://t.me/AusAuroraBot). 
It'll do alerts when aurora activity is high, and can tell you the [KP index](http://www.sws.bom.gov.au/Educational/1/2/4) for your city.

Next time I get some spare time, I'm going to put together a Twitter bot as well.
